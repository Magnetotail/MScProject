\begin_layout Title
MSc Project Proposal: Web Application for Community Detection in Large Scale
 Networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Andrew Walker: 1336061

\begin_layout Section
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Networks representing real systems often have a community structure.
 Vertices will be organised in communities, with many edges joining vertices
 of the same communities and comparatively few edges joining vertices of
 diï¬€erent communities

\end_inset

.
 Being able to find these structures can provide insight into how network
 function and topology affect each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Networks such as those provided in the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "StanfordUniversity2009"

\end_inset

 are becoming increasingly large and often have millions or billions of
 nodes and edges.
 This poses two main problems for finding community structures:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In order to process these graphs, more main memory is needed than that of
 an average personal computer.
 Therefore, many read and writes are needed to secondary storage which can
 be very computationly expensive.
 For computing efficiently on billions of edges, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 developed GraphChi, a disk-based system using a method that breaks large
 graphs up into small parts in a way that minimises the number of random
 read and writes to disk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Many algorithms used for identifying communities take polynomial time in
 the number of edges and/or vertices
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fortunato2010community"

\end_inset

.
 This is infeasible for large graphs.
 There are algorithms which can perform community detection in near linear
 time that are suitable for such large graphs:

\begin_layout Standard
Of further interest is the modelling of the network as the union of a dense
 core with a sparsely connected periphery, highlighting the role of each
 node on the basis of its topological position

\begin_layout Section
Project Outline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Develop a single-page web application that allows a user to upload a graph
 and visualise the community structure of that network.
 The project is broken down into the following four categories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Core 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user will be able to upload a file in limited specified formats that
 comply with GraphChi's expected input.
 On the server, label propagation will then be performed on this graph using
 GraphChi to identify the community structures.
 The user will then be shown an interactive visualisation of this resulting
 network structure along with measures of the quality of the communities
 detected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Core 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user will be able to choose the algorithm they would like to use to
 find the communities in the graph they upload.
 Their choices will be (1) Label propagation, (2) Louvain method or (3)
 ORCA.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Core 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user will be able to visualise the hierarchical community structure
 found by the Louvain method and ORCA.
 The user will be able to analyse the core-peripheral structure of the network.
 The user will be able to upload the communities in additional formats such
 as GML.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Extras
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Identify the core-periphery structure of networks with known influential
 members and investigate if these members can be identified from the topological
 structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The software development process will primarily be agile.
 Initially, a detailed set of requirements will be elicited from the above
 project outline.
 Each of the four categories above will be viewed as a separate iteration
 in the development process.
 A usable web application will be tested and deployed at the end of each
 iteration and the initial requirements will then be subject to feedback.

\begin_layout Standard
Software libraries used will all be open source.

\begin_layout Subsection
Hardware
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Users in the school have a 500MB storage limit on the network.
 For large graphs, more storage capacity will be needed in order to process
 the files.
 A request will be made to increase storage allowance to allow the analysis
 of these large graphs.
