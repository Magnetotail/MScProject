Web Application for Community Detection in Large Scale Networks
===============================================================

Work in progress...
-------------------

[GraphChi](https://github.com/GraphChi/graphchi-java) used for processing of graphs.

Choice of 3 algorithms to use for community detection in large networks:

- Label Propagation
- Louvain method (to do)
- Orca Reduction (to do)

Visualisation done with [Cytoscape.js](http://cytoscape.github.io/cytoscape.js/) and [arbor.js](http://arborjs.org/).
